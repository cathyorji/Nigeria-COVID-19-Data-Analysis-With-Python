# Nigeria-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-With-Python
Data Scientist Microdegree Capstone Project

# Project Overview
The unprecedented global outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has reshaped societies and economies, compelling nations to confront new challenges in healthcare, economy, and daily life.

Nigeria, a nation characterized by its cultural diversity and vibrant population, comprises 37 states (including the Federal Capital Territory) and 6 geopolitical zones. The onset of COVID-19 in Nigeria was observed on February 27, 2020, marking a critical juncture in the nation's response to the pandemic.

This data science project aims to leverage analytics techniques to unravel insights from the COVID-19 data specific to Nigeria. By harnessing the power of data, the goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the disease's impact on various regions within the country and to explore intricate relationships between different variables and the number of reported cases.

# Steps and Approaches
** Data Collection and Web Scraping:
3 datasets were used:
1) The NCDC Covid-19 data from their official website (https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/)
2) The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) data on daily confirmed, death, and recovered cases across different countries
3) The Nigeria Community Vulnerability Index Data

** Data Cleaning and Merging:
The data of interest was extracted from the 3 data sources, cleaned, and merged to form a dataframe
** Data Analysis:
Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used to perform visualization to extract insights from the collated data

# Future Work
Future work on this project will involve the integration of more datasets to uncover more insights related to the effects of covid-19 on the Nigerian economy.
Investigation into the impact of vaccination on Covid-19 effects, both health-wise and economically.
Comparative analysis of Nigeriaâ€™s response and outcomes with other countries to gain insights and lessons for future pandemic preparedness.
